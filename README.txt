SenTranslator UI

Takes the spreadsheets developed by Kitsune (and company) for Sen3 and Sen 4 and displays one line of dialogue at a time.

You must download an Excel (.xlsx) version of the spreadsheets in order to use this UI.
You should also have an up to date version of Java on your computer.

Begin by using the "Load" menu option to select either the Sen 3 or 4 excel file from your documents.
From there you can use the "Chapter" menu option to select a chapter.

The Next button advances the dialogue to the next line while the Previous button reverts it back a line.
You can type a number into the Line Number text field and press "Enter" to immediately jump to that line in the chapter.

This UI is only designed to work for the story chapters.  It will more than likely fail in another other spreadsheet tabs such as the Quartz tab.
